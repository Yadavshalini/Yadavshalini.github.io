	<h2>Additive</h2>
	<p>Additive color is color created by mixing a number of different light colors, with Red, green, and blue being the primary colors normally used in additive color system.</p>
	
    <h2>Subtractive</h2>
	<p>When we mix colors using paint, or through the printing process, we are using the subtractive color method. Subtractive color mixing means that one begins with white and ends with black; as one adds color, the result gets darker and tends to black.</p>

	<h2>Theory of Color</h2>
	<p>Color theories create a logical structure for color. For example, if we have an assortment of fruits and vegetables, we can organize them by color and place them on a circle that shows the colors in relation to each other.
	</p>
	<h3>Primary-Red, yellow and blue
In traditional color theory (used in paint and pigments), primary colors are the 3 pigment colors that can not be mixed or formed by any combination of other colors. All other colors are derived from these 3 hues.</h3>
	<h3>Secondary-Green, orange and purple
These are the colors formed by mixing the primary colors.
</h3>
	<h3>Tertiary-Yellow-orange, red-orange, red-purple, blue-purple, blue-green & yellow-green
These are the colors formed by mixing a primary and a secondary color. That's why the hue is a two word name, such as blue-green, red-violet, and yellow-orange.</h3>

	<h2>Color Models</h2>
	<p>Color models are used to classify colors and to qualify them according to such attributes as hue, saturation, chroma, lightness, or brightness. They are further used for matching colors and are valuable resources for anyone working with color in any medium: print, video, or Web.</p>
	<h3>Analogous-</h3>
	<p>Analogous are a method of representing a phenomenon of the world, often called the "target system" by another, more understandable or analysable system. They are also called dynamical analogi</p>
	<h3>Monochromatic</h3>
	<p>All the colors (tints, tones, and shades) of a single hue. Monochromatic color schemes are derived from a single base hue and extended using its shades, tones and tints. Tints are achieved by adding white and shades and tones are achieved by adding a darker color, gray or black.	</p>
	<h3>Triadic</h3>
	<p>A triadic color scheme uses colors that are evenly spaced around the color wheel. It tend to be quite vibrant, even if you use pale or unsaturated versions of your hues.</p>
	<h3>Complementary</h3>
	<p>Complementary colors are pairs of colors which, when combined, cancel each other out. This means that when combined, they produce a grey-scale color like white or black. When placed next to each other, they create the strongest contrast for those particular two colors.</p>
