    <h1> Eggless Vanilla Cupcake</h1>
  

<p>If you are allergic to egg but love to eat cupcake. Now you can enjoy eggless cupcake. With these simple easy steps.</p>

<h1>Ingredients</h1>
<ol>
<li>2 teaspoons Ener-G egg replacer powder</li>  
<li>3 tablespoons lukewarm water</li>
<li>1 and 3/4 cups Milk (2% milk)</li> 
<li>1/2 cup Water, divided</li>   
<li>1/2 cup Butter, melted</li>
<li>1 and 1/4 cups Sugar</li>
<li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons Vanilla Extract</li>
<li>2 and 1/2 cups All Purpose Flour</li> 
<li>2 and 1/2 teaspoons Baking Powder</li>  
<li>1/2 teaspoon Salt</li>    
</ol>


    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    
    <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven at 375F/190C for 15 minutes. Grease the muffin tins lightly or line it with paper liners. I brushed the inside of the liners with melted butter which gave a nice color on the sides of the cupcakes.
        </li>
    
    <li>Whip the egg replacer powder and 3 tablespoons of water, preferably in a blender for better results. Or just do it hand. The mixture should be frothy.</li>
    
    <li>Add the milk and 1/4 cup of water to the egg replacer mixture and stir it well.</li>
        
    <li>In a large bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set it aside.</li>
        
    <li>In another bowl, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. This may take upto 2-3 minutes.</li>
        
    <li>Add the vanilla extract and remaining 1/4 cup of water, and beat well.</li>
        
    <li>Add the flour mixture and the egg replacer/milk mixture in parts alternating.</li>
        
    <li>Beat until combined.</li>
    
    <li>Fill in the muffin cups 3/4th full and bake for about 20-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean. Mine was done around 24 minutes.</li>
        
    <li>Remove from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool.</li>
    </ol>
